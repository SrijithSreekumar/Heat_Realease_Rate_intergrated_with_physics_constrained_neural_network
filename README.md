## Data-driven discovery of heat release rate markers for premixed NH3/H2/air flames using physics-informed Machine learning

**General description:**

As it is impossible to detect heat release in a flame front directly in experiments, indirect heat release rate markers (usually represented by combination of species concentrations) become important for an accurate identification of the flame front. Our group has already worked strongly on optimizing heat release rate markers. Since the underlying link between the chemical markers  and the heat release rate is complicated and highly non-linear, artificial neural network (ANN) would be a suitable tool to establish a non-linear connection between the markers and the heat release rate, and thus helps the optimization of heat release rate markers in a more robust way. NH3/H2/air flames are becoming more and more interesting in association to zero-carbon, clean combustion. However, there is currently no proposed markers for detecting experimentally the flame front in such flames. Thus, the  present study involves data-driven discovery of optimal HRR markers for premixed NH3/H2/air flames using physics-informed machine learning (PIML).
